Files:

Lab2Complete.cct
     main circuit that accomplishes all requirements of lab2

ECCgenerator
    calculate parity bits and organizes data
BusXor
    used to flip bits in the location(s) provided and trasnfer data
MainMemory
    reads the 13 bits of data, indicates error(s), 
    fixes if there is only one error
ErrorLocation
    calculates the C value based on our parity bits
Decoder
    is a 4-16 with a enabler in order to use our C 
    value
